Kerby is a light weight, fast, efficient and extendible video surveillance system written
tu run efficiently on embedded GNU/Linux devices such as Fox boards, Alix boards, and so on.
It uses an algorithm of mine (still to be improved/optimized) to track motion on the video
buffer, if the motion value (computed as the percentage on the whole buffer) is higher than
a configurable threshold Kerby just start to record the video stream until there's no more
motion .
